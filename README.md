# BackupUtility
Solution containing two projects - a BackupUtility Library and an 'AppUI' WPF user interface intended for configuring BackupUtility.

Note: To corectly run the application, you may be required to add a .dll to GAC (Global Assembly Cache). This can be achieved by running Developer Command Prompt (Visual Studio), positioning in the folder which contains 'log4net.dll', and running the command <code>gacutil -i log4net.dll</code>
